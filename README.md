#### Main Features
* Image upload with size and file type restrictions
* Search by keyword and image
* Google authentication

#### Technologies Used
* **AWS S3** to store images
* **Google Vision API** to gather main keywords from any photo
* **Busboy** to process form data and file uploads
* **MongoDB + Mongoose** to store user and picture data
* **NextAuth.js** for Google user authentication
* **Jest + Supertest** for testing
* **React** and **React-Bootstrap** for frontend UI

## Setting up your local environment
Note that since this is a Next.js project, pages/api contains the backend. You will need:
* A dedicated MongoDB cluster to store data
* An AWS S3 bucket to store images
* Google Cloud account for authentication
* Google Vision API setup

Make sure to fill in the respective .env variables in .env.sample and rename .env.sample as .env.local.

Replace the 

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/udyding/shopify-backend-project.git
```
2. Install all dependencies:
```npm install```
3. Run the server:
```npm run dev```

### Testing
Testing was done using Jest and Supertest. The mongodb-memory-server npm package was used to create an in-memory MongoDB server to test database calls. To run:
```
npm run test
```

### Future Improvements
* Add geolocations to pictures so users can filter by nearest restaurants
* Improve responsiveness of website UI
