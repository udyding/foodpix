## Description
Foodpix is an image repository application that allows users to share pictures of meals and browse pictures based on keywords or image search. 

### Main Features
* Image upload with size restrictions
* Search by keyword and image
* Google authentication

### Technologies Used
* AWS S3 to store images
* Google Vision API to gather main keywords from any photo
* Formidable to process form data and allow file uploads in Node.js
* MongoDB + Mongoose to store user and picture data
* NextAuth.js for Google user authentication
* Jest + Supertest for testing
* Next.js, Typescript, and React

## Setting up local environment
Note that as this is a Next.js project, pages/api contains the backend. You will need:
* A dedicated MongoDB cluster to store data
* An AWS S3 bucket to store images

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/udyding/shopify-backend-project.git
```
2. Install all dependencies:
```npm install```
3. Run the server:
```npm run dev```

### Testing
Testing was done using Jest and Supertest. To run:
```npm run test```

### Future Improvements
* Implement a delete picture functionality
* Add geolocations to pictures so users can filter by nearest restaurants
* Improve responsiveness of website UI
